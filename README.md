# Insertion-Sort---Part-1-algo
This program fixes the Insertion Sort - Part 1 problem by showing the performance of one iteration of insertion sort wherein the last element is inserted in its proper place. The program moves elements to the right to accommodate the value being inserted and prints the array after every movement, then inserts the value in its proper final position.
